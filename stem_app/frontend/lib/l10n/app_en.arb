  "soilTypeBasic": "Basic/Alkaline Soil (e.g., Chalky)",
  "soilPhExplanationAcidic": "The natural indicator (like turmeric) turns yellow/remains yellow in acidic soil. Many plants struggle in highly acidic soil; adding lime can help raise the pH.",
  "soilPhExplanationNeutral": "The natural indicator turns yellow/remains yellow in neutral soil. Most common plants thrive in neutral pH (around 6.5-7.0).",
  "soilPhExplanationBasic": "The natural indicator turns reddish-brown/red in basic (alkaline) soil. Some plants prefer alkaline conditions, but high alkalinity can limit nutrient availability for others. Adding organic matter can help lower pH.",

  "solutionWater": "Plain Water",

  "osmosisExplanationWater": "In plain water, the water concentration outside the potato cells is higher than inside. Water moves into the cells via osmosis, causing the potato slice to become slightly larger and firmer (turgid).",
  "osmosisExplanationSaltwater": "In salt water, the water concentration outside the potato cells is lower than inside (due to dissolved salt). Water moves out of the cells via osmosis, causing the potato slice to shrink and become limp (flaccid).",
